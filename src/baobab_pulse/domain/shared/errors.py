"""Domain-level errors.

These are the only exceptions the domain layer raises. Infrastructure and
provider-specific exceptions (Haystack, asyncpg, httpx, ...) are translated
into these — or into ``baobab_pulse.infrastructure`` error types that
subclass :class:`PulseError` — at the relevant anti-corruption boundary; they
never cross into application/domain code directly (req. #120).
