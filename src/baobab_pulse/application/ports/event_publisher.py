"""EventPublisher port — the transactional-outbox write side.

PULSE-016 / item 58: Pulse events are published through a transactional
outbox, not a direct broker call inside a request/analysis handler.
Consumers MUST assume at-least-once delivery (item 59) — handlers on the
*consuming* side are Pulse's own concern to make idempotent; this port only
covers the write ("append this event to the outbox atomically with the state
change that produced it").
